I like to know things. My interests include reading all of the internet, pub quiz, saving articles on the internet to read later, investigating better ways to do things (usually with R) and a little frisbee as well. 

I grew up in Taranaki, went to Auckland University, and work for Mercury. 

This site is an experimentation in making my own website.
